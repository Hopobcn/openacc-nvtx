It is intended particularly for\r\nidentifying implicit data motion that occurs in OpenACC regions when data\r\nlocality has not been explicitly managed by the programmer. This is done by\r\nannotating the GPU timeline with NVTX ranges for compute and data constructs.\r\nWhen viewed with nvprof or NVIDIA Visual Profiler the programmer will be able\r\nto time specific GPU events, such as PCIe copies or compute kernels, to the\r\nOpenACC regions in the code.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\n### Building the Library ###\r\nThe library can be built with the `make` command. It has been testing with PGI\r\n15.5 and CUDA 7.0.\r\n\r\n### Using the Library ###\r\nTo use the library, set the PGI_ACC_PROFLIB environment variable to point to\r\nthe full path of the shared object file `libaccnvtx.so`. Then run the program\r\nusing the `nvprof` command.\r\n\r\n    $ export PGI_ACC_PROFLIB=$PATH_TO_LIB/libaccnvtx.so\r\n    $ nvprof ./a.out\r\n\r\nOptionally, you can choose to output a file from nvprof to import into the NVIDIA\r\nVisual Profiler.\r\n\r\n    $ export PGI_ACC_PROFLIB=$PATH_TO_LIB/libaccnvtx.so\r\n    $ nvprof -o out.nvp ./a.out\r\n\r\nWhen imported into NVIDIA Visual Profiler data regions (explicit and implicit),\r\nenter and exit data directives, and update directives will use a red range,\r\ncompute construct kernels (both the `parallel` and `kernels` directives) will\r\nbe green, implicit waits will be yellow, and explicit waits will use a purple\r\nrange.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of Visual Profiler using NVTX Ranges for OpenACC constructs.](images/visual_profiler_sample.png)\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n-----\r\nFuture versions of the PGI compiler will implement the final tools API from the\r\nOpenACC 2.5 spec. The wrappers will be updated at that time.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\nCopyright 2015 NVIDIA Corporation\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\nlimitations under the License.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
